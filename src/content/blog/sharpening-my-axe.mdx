I am, and always have been, a notorious procrastinator. That said, there's an Abraham Lincoln quote I think about a lot. I even printed it out at a job once and hung it up in a conference room to passive aggressively encourage some coworkers to prep for an upcoming project with an agressive deadline.

```
Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax.
```

Apparently there is some [discrepancy about whether or not Lincoln actually said this](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/29/sharp-axe/), but he is who I've always heard this attributed to and I'm pretty dead set on using that image of good, ole Abraham from Adventure Time for the image for this post...

So why is this a blog post? Well, I'm glad you asked. The current iteration of my blog (running Gatsby hosted on Netlify as of this post) as 521 commits, with the first being \
```
"initial commit after gatsby new" committed on Jan 23, 2015
```
It's been almost two entire years since that first commit, and even ignoring the Jekyll and Wordpress iterations of the site that came before, at no point would I have ever said "yeah, the site is toally done and I'm happy with it."

Realistically, I know the jokes of a designer never being happy with their portfolio personal brand or a developer never being happy with their own website have a lot of truth behind them because of the nature of creative people, but personally, I waste a lot of time. I don't even mean all the time I was flat out not working on my website, I mean all the times I open the project and just sort of wander around the codebase. \_I could refactor this to use React hooks instead of lifecycle methods here\_, _I could abstract out some of the redundant styles in these two files, or \_I could change my testing framework again...\_

Another quote I think about a lot is JRR Tolkein's "Not all those who wander are lost" poem, but at a certain point I have to stop and ask myself "what the heck are you even doing anymore?"


So all of THAT to say, I have some down time coming up next week, and I want to finally sharpen my axe.
