## Final Fantasy 1

general onboarding
- didn't know difference between twon and castle
- only thing was "four people holding an orb"
- guy who says "select and b" backwards

combat
- didn't know difference between equipping and holding items
- why show magic left if you know no magic?
- spells that hit everyone don't let you target anyone

left to right is interesting becuase japanese
hitting an enemy, it dying, triggers "ineffective" instead of atacking next in line enemy
