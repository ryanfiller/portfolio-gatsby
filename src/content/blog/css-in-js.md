## why I switched to css in js

separation of concerns

conditional rendering instead of display: none

performance?

deleting components


## why I went back

sourcemaps are garbage

bem made scoping never an issue

missing scss fuctions, colors and math

double mental model, never stop having to think about css

shared styles, work stuff


## did it solve the problems

functional pages without styles, are they really the same concern?

conditional rendering, you can still do it but its kind of lame
