## why I switched to css in js

separation of concerns

conditional rendering instead of display: none

performance?

deleting components


## why I went back

sourcemaps are garbage

bem made scoping never an issue

missing scss fuctions, colors and math

double mental model, never stop having to think about css


## did it solve the problems

functional pages without styles, are they really the same concern?

conditional rendering, you can still do it but its kind of lame
