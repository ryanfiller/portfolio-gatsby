The Crump Firm is a Memphis based based architecture firm that's been designing both public and private buildings for almost 50 years. In line with the firm's mission statement of "Creating Inspired Architecture That Endures," RocketFuel designed a unique site based heavily on photography that was also meant to endure.

Because the clients were able to provide a large amount of great photography and the existing branding already being minimal, the site was mostly built around large areas of flat color combined with large images.
